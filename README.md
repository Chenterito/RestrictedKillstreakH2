# RestrictedKillstreakH2
GSC script to restrict Killstreaks for H2M

# How to implement.

Copy the file ""RestrictKillStreakH2.gsc" into "user_scripts\mp" of your COD MWR folder.
 
```set streaksRestricted "radar_mp counter_radar_mp airdrop_marker_mp sentry_mp predator_mp airstrike_mp harrier_airstrike_mp helicopter_mp airdrop_mega_marker_mp stealth_airstrike_mp pavelow_mp chopper_gunner_mp ac130_mp emp_mp nuke_mp"``` Set in your server configuration file, separating the streaks you need to restrict with a space, like the example.  If you don't, by default the script will not restrict anything.
